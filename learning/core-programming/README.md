# 📘 Core Programming & Problem Solving - SkillSyncHub

Welcome to the **Core Programming & Problem Solving** module. This is the foundation of your SkillSyncHub journey — where you'll master essential concepts, build logic, and develop strong coding habits across multiple programming languages.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- 🔹 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- 🔹 Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- 🔹 Problem-Solving Strategies

Each topic includes implementations in multiple languages: **Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript**, to give you a cross-paradigm perspective.
